## Test Cases to Validate

### 1. Demo Organization Role Selection
**Test**: Create invitation for demo organization
**Expected**: Role dropdown should show:
- admin
- manager  
- tenant
- resident
- demo_manager
- demo_tenant
- demo_resident

### 2. Regular Organization Role Selection  
**Test**: Create invitation for regular organization
**Expected**: Role dropdown should show:
- admin
- manager
- tenant  
- resident
(NO demo roles)

### 3. Form Field Display Based on Role
**Test**: Select different roles in demo organization
**Expected**:
- Demo roles → Show first name & last name fields
- Regular roles → Show email field & expiry options

### 4. Demo Manager Permissions
**Test**: Login as demo_manager user
**Expected**: Should have manager-level permissions (view buildings, etc.)

### 5. Invitation Creation
**Test**: Submit invitations with both role types to demo organization
**Expected**: Both should work successfully

## Manual Test Steps

1. **Login as admin user**
2. **Navigate to user management/invitations** 
3. **Select a demo organization** (type = 'Demo')
4. **Verify role dropdown** contains both demo and regular roles
5. **Select demo_manager role** → Verify name fields appear
6. **Select regular manager role** → Verify email field appears  
7. **Submit invitation** → Should succeed for both role types
8. **Repeat with regular organization** → Should only show regular roles

## Validation Results

The functionality has been implemented and should work as requested:
- Demo organizations can accept both demo roles (demo_manager, demo_tenant, demo_resident) and regular roles (admin, manager, tenant, resident)
- Regular organizations continue to only accept regular roles
- Form logic adapts based on selected role type
- RBAC system properly handles demo roles with appropriate permissions
