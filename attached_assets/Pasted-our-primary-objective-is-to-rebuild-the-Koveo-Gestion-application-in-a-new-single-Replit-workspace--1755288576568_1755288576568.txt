our primary objective is to rebuild the Koveo Gestion application in a new, single Replit workspace. This will be a comprehensive, multi-phase project.

Business Context: Koveo Gestion Inc.
You are building a SaaS (Software as a Service) application for Koveo Gestion inc., a Quebec-based company.

Application Name: Koveo Gestion

Core Purpose: The application is an AI-powered property management platform designed specifically for Quebec's residential communities, syndicates, and co-ownership properties. It is an all-in-one tool that centralizes knowledge and automates key property management tasks.

Key Functionalities: The platform must help property managers and owners to:

Maintain up-to-date documentation for properties and owners.

Manage the maintenance log and track requests.

Manage and simulate provident fund studies.

Plan and schedule work on common areas.

Manage complaints and requests from owners or tenants.

Provide AI-powered insights and recommendations.

Compliance: The application must be built with Quebec Law 25 compliance in mind.

Language: The application must support both French and English.

Technical Task: Workspace Initialization
Initialize a new, single Replit workspace named koveo-gestion-rebuilt.

Your task is to select and configure a template for a modern, full-stack web application. My preference is for a robust, TypeScript-based framework that is well-supported on Replit, such as Next.js, but I am open to your expert recommendation for the best integrated solution to achieve our business goals.

Guiding Principles: The Pillar Methodology
Our first and most critical priority is to establish a rigorous, automated development framework based on a set of internal "Pillars." These pillars will act as the "operating system" for our development process, ensuring quality, consistency, and maintainability.

Do not write any application-specific business logic yet. Our initial phase is dedicated entirely to building this internal framework.

Action Item
Acknowledge that you have understood this initial setup and the business context. Then, initialize the workspace using your recommended template. Once complete, confirm you are ready to proceed with the creation of the first pillar: the "Validation & Quality Assurance Pillar."
