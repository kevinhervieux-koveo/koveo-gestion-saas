# Feature Development Request: Integrate authentification login to the app

## 🎯 Overview
**Category:** Compliance & Security
**Current Status:** submitted
**Priority:** critical
**Description:** Integrate RBAC authentification login to the app
create a login page
anybody can access the website
nobody can access the app without being authentificate
create validation and test
use koveo-gestion-exhaustive-docs to define the base line of our RBAC

## 📋 Business Requirements

### Business Objective
security and control to informaiton for users

### Target Users
all users that have access to the app

### Success Metrics
non authenticated user can't access the app by the login button or the url


### Timeline
now

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Complexity Assessment
Medium complexity

### Dependencies
user database

### Data Requirements
user information, password must use bcrypt

### Integration Needs
Standard system integration

### Security Considerations
control the read or write access of users, they should notsee the information of other users

## 👤 User Experience Requirements

### User Flow
Enter the main website and can login to the app.
once in the app should have limited access based on role 

### UI Requirements
login page fits the style of rest of the app and is professionnal

### Accessibility Needs
accessible on any browser and mobile device

## ⚡ Performance & Quality Requirements

### Performance Requirements
Standard performance expectations

### Testing Strategy
extensive testing with 0% tolerance for errors

## 📝 Implementation Guidelines

**CRITICAL: This feature must be implemented with the highest standards of quality, maintainability, and best practices.**

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow TypeScript strict mode and maintain 100% type safety
- Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Use consistent naming conventions and clear, self-documenting code
- Add thorough JSDoc comments for all exported functions and interfaces
- Maintain test coverage above 90% for all new code

### Architecture & Design Patterns
- Follow the existing project architecture (React + Express + PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM)
- Use established patterns: React Query for data fetching, Zod for validation
- Implement proper separation of concerns (UI components, business logic, data layer)
- Follow SOLID principles and avoid code duplication
- Use composition over inheritance where applicable

### User Interface Standards
- Use the established shadcn/ui component system exclusively
- Ensure responsive design works on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Follow the existing design tokens and color scheme
- Implement proper loading states, error states, and empty states
- Add appropriate micro-interactions and transitions

### Database & Backend Standards
- Create proper database migrations using Drizzle Kit
- Implement input validation on both client and server sides using Zod schemas
- Follow RESTful API conventions and proper HTTP status codes
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Ensure proper data relationships and foreign key constraints

### Security & Performance
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS and injection attacks
- Use prepared statements and parameterized queries
- Optimize database queries and add proper indexing
- Implement caching strategies where appropriate

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all business logic and utility functions
- Add integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
- Include component tests for React components with user interactions
- Test error scenarios and edge cases thoroughly
- Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Documentation & Maintenance
- Update the project's replit.md file with any architectural changes
- Add inline comments explaining complex business logic
- Create clear commit messages following conventional commit format
- Ensure backward compatibility unless explicitly requested otherwise
