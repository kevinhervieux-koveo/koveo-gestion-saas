# ✅ SAFE Production Hotfix - Document Upload Fix

## What This Fix Does

✓ **Fixes document upload 500 errors** in your production application  
✓ **No database changes** - completely safe for live production  
✓ **Uses simplified storage system** that works with your existing database  
✓ **Schema now matches production** - prevents future conflicts  

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Do NOT Run Database Migrations

Your application is now built and ready for production deployment:

### 1. Upload Built Files
Upload these folders to your production server:
- `dist/index.js` (your server application)

```
