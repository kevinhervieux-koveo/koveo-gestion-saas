# Koveo Gestion Development Framework

## Overview
Koveo Gestion is an AI-powered SaaS platform for property management, specifically designed for Quebec's residential communities. It offers comprehensive tools for documentation, maintenance, financial planning, and complaint management, ensuring compliance with Law 25 and supporting both French and English. The project aims to deliver a robust, enterprise-grade application using a rigorous, automated development system called the "Pillar Methodology," with significant market potential in Quebec's co-ownership properties.

## Recent Changes (August 2025)
- **Code Redundancy Analysis Test Suite**: Created comprehensive test suite with 105+ test cases to identify and reduce code redundancies across forms, buttons, cards, and formatting. Includes automated component extraction analysis, style consolidation recommendations, and design token generation with implementation strategy
- **Comprehensive French and English Language Validation**: Created extensive test suite with 170+ test cases covering translation completeness, Quebec French quality, Law 25 compliance, form validation, and content display across all application components
- **Quebec Law 25 Compliance Testing**: Added specialized tests for privacy terminology, legal document translations, consent forms, and breach notification language to ensure full compliance with Quebec privacy legislation
- **Multi-language Form Validation**: Implemented comprehensive form validation testing with Quebec French terminology (courriel vs email), proper typography rules, and culturally appropriate error messages
- **Content Display Internationalization**: Built end-to-end tests for seamless language switching, date/time formatting, address formats, and regional preferences with performance validation
- **Text Formatting and Overflow Tests**: Created visual regression tests specifically addressing card text overflow issues from provided screenshots, with CSS utilities for proper text handling and responsive layouts
- **Document Management System Completed**: Full document management system with role-based access control for buildings and residences. Features include document upload/download, categorization, and assignment to specific buildings/residences with proper permissions (Admin: full access, Manager: organization-wide, Resident: residence and building documents, Tenant: view-only based on assignments)
- **Document Navigation Fixed**: Document buttons on buildings and residences pages now use proper SPA navigation instead of full page reloads, preventing redirect issues to home page
- **SelectItem Validation Fixed**: Resolved validation error in Documents page by changing empty string values to proper "all" values for category filters
- **Responsive Forms Implementation**: All forms across the application are now responsive with single scroll bar behavior. Forms use max-h-[90vh] with overflow-y-auto on dialog containers to ensure they fit within viewport height while remaining scrollable when content exceeds screen dimensions
- **Object Storage Integration**: Replit object storage integration with file upload functionality, presigned URLs, and ACL policies for secure document management
- **Password Reset System Completed**: Full password reset functionality with secure token-based authentication, email integration, comprehensive frontend pages, and working API integration
- **Registration System Completed**: Multi-step registration wizard with invitation token validation, password creation, and Quebec Law 25 privacy consent fully implemented and tested
- **Database Schema Enhanced**: Added password_reset_tokens table with security features (token expiration, one-time use, SHA-256 hashing)
- **Email Service Integration**: SendGrid integration for password reset emails with French/English templates, disabled link tracking for direct URL access, uses FRONTEND_URL environment variable for correct domain
- **Frontend Pages Added**: Forgot password and reset password pages with proper styling, error handling, and public route authentication
- **Security Features**: Password reset tokens expire after 1 hour, secure token generation, proper validation, and enhanced password requirements (8+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- **Database Schema Fixed**: Added missing username field to users table and updated user creation logic
- **Privacy Consent Enhanced**: Collapsible "Collecte et traitement des donn√©es" section with master checkbox functionality
- **Contact Information Updated**: Phone number displays correct "514-712-8441" from PHONE_CONTACT secret

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite.
- **UI**: Shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI) and Tailwind CSS.
- **Routing**: Wouter.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query.
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
- **Internationalization**: Custom language provider for English and French.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.
- **API**: RESTful API with typed request/response handling.
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL.
- **Validation**: Zod schemas.

### Data Storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM and Neon serverless database.
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and TypeScript integration.

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store.
- **User Management**: Custom username/password system.
- **RBAC**: Four-tier role hierarchy (Admin, Manager, Tenant, Resident) with granular permissions.
- **Access Control**: Organization-based access rules (Demo, Koveo, normal organizations, tenant/resident specific).
- **Security**: Law 25 compliance framework.
- **Invitation System**: Role-based user invitation with organization/residence assignment, audit logging, SendGrid email integration, automatic replacement of existing invitations, and simplified process without 2FA. Complete multi-step registration wizard with token validation, password creation, and Quebec Law 25 privacy consent with collapsible data collection section and master checkbox functionality.
- **Buildings Management**: Comprehensive building management system with role-based access control where Admin and Manager roles can view all buildings in their organization, while Resident and Tenant roles are restricted from accessing Manager and Admin features. Features include real-time search functionality for building names and addresses, admin-only building creation with organization assignment, and edit/delete capabilities (Admin and Manager can edit all building information, only Admin can delete buildings). Special privilege: Koveo organization users have global access to view buildings from all organizations.
- **Residences Management**: Complete residences management system with automatic generation of residences when buildings are created (max 300 units per building). Features include advanced search by unit number or assigned person name, filtering by building and floor, pagination with 10 residences per page, and comprehensive edit functionality. Each residence supports multiple parking spots and storage spaces as arrays. Role-based access ensures users can only see residences in buildings they have access to. No create/delete buttons exist since residences are auto-generated from building data.
