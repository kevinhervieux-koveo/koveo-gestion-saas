# Quebec Property Management RBAC Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for the Quebec property management platform with the following specific access rules:

## Access Rules Implemented

### 1. Demo Organization (Public Access)
- **Rule**: Everybody can see the Demo organization
- **Implementation**: Demo organization is always included in accessible organizations for all users
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented

### 2. Demo Organization Users (Limited Access)
- **Rule**: Users in the Demo organization can't see anybody else
- **Implementation**: Demo users can only access Demo organization, no other organizations
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented

### 3. Koveo Organization (Full Access)
- **Rule**: Users in Koveo organization can see everything and everybody
- **Implementation**: Koveo users have `can_access_all_organizations = true`
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented

### 4. Normal Organizations (Limited Access)
- **Rule**: Users in normal organizations (like "563 montée des pionniers") can only see what's in their organization and the Demo
- **Implementation**: Normal org users can access their own organization + Demo (public)
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented

### 5. Residents/Tenants (Residence-Level Access)
- **Rule**: Residents and tenants have access to their residences and buildings only
- **Implementation**: Residence-level access control based on user_residences table
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`server/rbac.ts`** - Core RBAC logic
   - `getUserAccessibleOrganizations()` - Get organizations user can access
   - `getUserAccessibleResidences()` - Get residences user can access
   - `canUserAccessOrganization()` - Check organization access
   - `canUserAccessBuilding()` - Check building access
   - `canUserAccessResidence()` - Check residence access
   - Middleware functions for route protection

2. **`server/auth.ts`** - Enhanced authentication
   - Added organization information to authenticated user object
   - Fetches user's organization memberships and access levels

3. **`server/routes.ts`** - RBAC-protected API routes
   - `/api/organizations` - List accessible organizations
   - `/api/organizations/:id` - Get specific organization
   - `/api/buildings` - List accessible buildings
   - `/api/buildings/:id` - Get specific building
   - `/api/residences` - List accessible residences
   - `/api/residences/:id` - Get specific residence
   - `/api/users/me/organizations` - User's accessible organizations
   - `/api/users/me/residences` - User's accessible residences

### Database Structure Utilized

```sql
-- Organizations with access control
organizations (id, name, type, is_active)

-- User-Organization relationships with access levels
user_organizations (
  user_id, 
  organization_id, 
  can_access_all_organizations, -- Koveo admin flag
  is_active
)

-- User-Residence relationships for tenant/resident access
user_residences (
  user_id,
  residence_id,
  relationship_type, -- 'owner', 'tenant', 'resident'
  is_active
)
```

### Access Control Matrix

| User Type | Demo Org | Koveo Org | Normal Orgs | Own Residences | Other Residences |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Demo Users | ✅ Full | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✅ Own Only | ❌ None |
| Koveo Admin | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ✅ All | ✅ All |
| Normal Org Admin/Manager | ✅ View | ❌ None | ✅ Own Org | ✅ Org Buildings | ❌ Other Orgs |
| Residents/Tenants | ✅ View | ❌ None | ✅ Own Org View | ✅ Own Only | ❌ None |

## API Endpoints with RBAC

### Organizations
- `GET /api/organizations` - Returns only accessible organizations
- `GET /api/organizations/:id` - Checks organization access
- `GET /api/organizations/:id/buildings` - Lists buildings in accessible organization

### Buildings
- `GET /api/buildings` - Returns only accessible buildings
- `GET /api/buildings/:id` - Checks building access
- `GET /api/buildings/:id/residences` - Lists residences in accessible building

### Residences
- `GET /api/residences` - Returns only accessible residences
- `GET /api/residences/:id` - Checks residence access

### User Access Info
- `GET /api/users/me/organizations` - User's accessible organizations
- `GET /api/users/me/residences` - User's accessible residences

## Security Features

### 1. Middleware Protection
- All routes protected with `requireAuth` middleware
- Organization/building/residence-specific middleware available
- Dynamic access checking based on user context

### 2. Database Query Filtering
- Automatic filtering at database level using `inArray()` conditions
- Prevents data leakage through SQL injection or bypass attempts
- Efficient queries with proper indexes

### 3. Role-Based Logic
- Admin/Manager roles: Organization-wide access within permissions
- Tenant/Resident roles: Residence-specific access only
- Special handling for Koveo organization (full access)
- Demo organization treated as public resource

## Testing Data Created

The system has been tested with:
- **3 Organizations**: Demo (public), Koveo (admin), 563 montée des pionniers (normal)
- **3 Buildings**: 2 in Demo, 1 in 563 montée des pionniers
- **15 Residences**: Distributed across buildings
- **15 Users**: Various roles with proper organization assignments

## Usage Examples

### For Frontend Components
```typescript
// Get user's accessible organizations
const organizations = await fetch('/api/users/me/organizations');

// Get buildings in specific organization (with automatic access check)
const buildings = await fetch(`/api/organizations/${orgId}/buildings`);

// Get user's residences (automatic filtering)
const residences = await fetch('/api/users/me/residences');
```

### For Backend Routes
```typescript
// Use RBAC middleware
app.get('/api/some-route', requireAuth, requireOrganizationAccess('organizationId'), handler);

// Manual access check
const hasAccess = await canUserAccessOrganization(userId, organizationId);
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Indexes**: Proper indexes on foreign keys and access patterns
2. **Caching**: User organization memberships cached in session
3. **Efficient Queries**: Uses database-level filtering instead of application filtering
4. **Lazy Loading**: RBAC functions imported dynamically to avoid circular dependencies

## Compliance

- **Quebec Law 25**: User data access properly restricted and auditable
- **Multi-tenant Security**: Proper data isolation between organizations
- **Audit Trail**: All access decisions can be logged and traced
- **Privacy Protection**: Users only see data they're authorized to access

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The RBAC system is fully implemented and operational with all requested access rules:
- Demo organization is public ✅
- Demo users can't see other organizations ✅
- Koveo users can see everything ✅ 
- 563 montée des pionniers users can see themselves + Demo ✅
- Residents/tenants only see their own residences ✅
