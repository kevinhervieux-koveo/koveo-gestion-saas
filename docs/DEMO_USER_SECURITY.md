# Demo User Security Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive security system implemented to ensure demo users have proper view-only access and cannot perform destructive operations.

## Overview

The demo user security system enforces different levels of access:

- **Regular Demo Users** (`@demo.com`): Full access within Demo organization
- **Open Demo Users** (`@opendemo.com`): View-only access, cannot modify any data
- **Regular Users**: Full access within their assigned organizations

## Security Components

### 1. Backend Security (RBAC)

#### Functions in `server/rbac.ts`:

- `isOpenDemoUser(userId)`: Identifies Open Demo users
- `canUserPerformWriteOperation(userId, action)`: Checks write permissions
- `getUserAccessibleOrganizations(userId)`: Gets accessible organizations

#### Middleware in `server/middleware/demo-security.ts`:

- `enforceDemoSecurity()`: General write operation restrictions
- `enforceFileUploadSecurity()`: File upload restrictions
- `enforceBulkOperationSecurity()`: Bulk operation restrictions
- `enforceExportSecurity()`: Data export restrictions

### 2. Error Handling

#### Elegant Error Messages

All restriction errors include:

- **Bilingual support** (English/French)
- **User-friendly language** (no technical jargon)
- **Clear explanations** of demo limitations
- **Contact information** for full accounts
- **Consistent structure** across all endpoints

Example error response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "code": "DEMO_RESTRICTED",
  "title": "Demo Mode - View Only",
  "message": "This is a demonstration account with view-only access.",
  "messageEn": "This is a demonstration account with view-only access.",
  "messageFr": "Ceci est un compte de dÃ©monstration avec accÃ¨s en consultation seulement.",
  "suggestion": "Contact us for a full account to make changes.",
  "contact": "Contact our team to get started with your own workspace."
}
```

### 3. Restricted Operations

#### Open Demo Users Cannot:

- **Create** users, buildings, residences, documents
- **Update** any existing data
- **Delete** any records
- **Upload** files or documents
- **Perform bulk operations** (import/export)
- **Modify** their own profile or organization
- **Access admin functions**

#### Open Demo Users Can:

- **View** all data they have access to
- **Search and filter** content
- **Download** existing documents
- **Navigate** the application
- **Use read-only features**

## Test Suite

### 1. Security Tests

#### `tests/security/demo-users-validation.test.ts`

- Validates demo user data integrity
- Ensures no admin users in demo organizations
- Verifies realistic Quebec names and email patterns
- Checks role restrictions

#### `tests/security/comprehensive-demo-user-security.test.ts`

- End-to-end API security tests
- Tests all CRUD operations restrictions
- Validates error message quality
- Tests security edge cases and bypass attempts

#### `tests/integration/demo-user-ui-restrictions.test.tsx`

- Frontend UI restriction tests
- Error message display validation
- Accessibility and user experience tests
- Progressive disclosure testing

### 2. Test Runner

#### `tests/security/demo-security-test-runner.ts`

- Comprehensive test execution
- Security status reporting
- Critical failure detection
- Recommendations for security issues

Run all demo security tests:

```bash
tsx tests/security/demo-security-test-runner.ts
```

## Security Patterns

### 1. Defense in Depth

Security is enforced at multiple layers:

1. **Database level**: User role validation
2. **API middleware**: Route-level restrictions
3. **Business logic**: Function-level checks
4. **Frontend**: UI component restrictions

### 2. Fail-Safe Defaults

- Unknown users default to restricted access
- Missing permissions default to deny
- Errors default to restrictive responses
- Failed checks default to view-only mode

### 3. User Experience Priority

- Clear, non-technical error messages
- Consistent restriction patterns
- Helpful guidance for upgrading
- Maintained functionality for allowed actions

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Security Violation Logging

All restricted actions are logged with:

```
ðŸš« Open Demo user {userId} ({email}) attempted restricted action: {method} {path}
```

### Metrics Tracked

- Number of restriction violations per user
- Most commonly attempted restricted actions
- Error message effectiveness (user feedback)
- Demo user engagement patterns

## Maintenance

### Regular Security Reviews

1. **Monthly**: Review demo user activity logs
2. **Quarterly**: Update test coverage for new features
3. **Before releases**: Run full security test suite
4. **After incidents**: Review and strengthen restrictions

### Adding New Restrictions

When adding new features:

1. Add RBAC checks to backend functions
2. Apply middleware to new API endpoints
3. Update frontend components with restrictions
4. Add corresponding security tests
5. Update error messages if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tests failing**: Check database connectivity and demo organizations
2. **UI not restricting**: Verify auth context and user role detection
3. **API allowing writes**: Check middleware application order
4. **Error messages not showing**: Verify frontend error handling

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check demo user data
npm run db:studio

# Test specific security function
tsx -e "import { isOpenDemoUser } from './server/rbac'; console.log(await isOpenDemoUser('user-id'))"

# Run specific test suite
npm test tests/security/demo-users-validation.test.ts

# Check middleware application
grep -r "enforceDemoSecurity" server/
```

## Security Contact

For security concerns related to demo user restrictions:

1. Review test results in the security test runner
2. Check application logs for violation patterns
3. Verify user organization assignments
4. Escalate critical failures immediately

This security system ensures demo users can explore the full application functionality while maintaining data integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications.
