# Koveo Gestion Quality System Overview

## ðŸŽ¯ Complete Code Review & Quality System Established

Koveo Gestion now has a comprehensive, mandatory code review and automated quality system in place that ensures code maintainability while preserving existing functionality and maintaining type safety.

## ðŸ”§ System Components

### 1. Automated Quality Checks (CI/CD)

**GitHub Actions Workflows:**
- `.github/workflows/quality-check.yml` - Comprehensive quality validation
- `.github/workflows/enforce-review.yml` - PR requirement enforcement

**Quality Gates (All Mandatory):**
- âœ… Static Analysis (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier)
- âœ… Testing Suite (Unit, Integration, E2E) with 80% coverage requirement
- âœ… Security Scanning (No critical/high vulnerabilities allowed)
- âœ… Quebec Compliance (Bilingual, Accessibility, Law 25)
- âœ… Build Validation (Client + Server builds must succeed)
- âœ… Code Complexity (â‰¤10 cyclomatic complexity enforced)

### 2. Pre-Commit Quality Enforcement

**Husky Git Hooks:**
- `pre-commit` - Runs lint-staged, type checking, and formatting
- `pre-push` - Full validation suite before push
- `commit-msg` - Conventional commit format validation

**Lint-Staged Configuration:**
- Automatic ESLint fixing and Prettier formatting
- TypeScript type checking on staged files
- JSON/CSS/Markdown formatting

### 3. Advanced Quality Analysis

**Existing Sophisticated Framework:**
- Code complexity analysis with thresholds
- Test coverage tracking with effectiveness metrics
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Translation coverage for Quebec bilingual requirements
- Accessibility compliance validation (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Component test coverage analysis
- Performance monitoring and build time tracking

**Quality Scripts:**
- `scripts/run-quality-check.ts` - Comprehensive quality analysis
- `scripts/run-quality-metric-tests.ts` - Quality metrics effectiveness validation
- Automated improvement suggestion generation and tracking

### 4. Mandatory Code Review Process

**Branch Protection Rules:**
- Main and develop branches require PR reviews
- Minimum 1 approval from CODEOWNERS required
- All status checks must pass before merge
- No direct pushes allowed
- Stale reviews dismissed on new commits

**Review Requirements:**
- Technical review for all code changes
- Security review for authentication/authorization changes
- Quebec compliance review for legal/regulatory changes
- Database review for schema changes

**CODEOWNERS Configuration:**
- Global tech leads for all files
- Specialized teams for security, database, compliance areas
- Mandatory reviews for critical system components

## ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Quebec-Specific Quality Assurance
