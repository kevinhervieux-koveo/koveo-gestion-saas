```

### Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**: Create feature branches from `main`
2. **Code Quality**: All code must pass linting, type checking, and tests
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation for new features
4. **Testing**: Maintain 80%+ test coverage
5. **Review**: All changes require code review

## User Roles & Permissions

The platform implements a comprehensive RBAC system with four main roles:
