I've completed significant infrastructure improvements to the comprehensive test suite for the Quebec property management system, working toward achieving 746/746 tests passing (100% pass rate).

Critical infrastructure fixes completed:
✅ PostgreSQL mocking infrastructure (.array() method support)
✅ ES module compatibility (server config exports)
✅ Schema validation framework (.extend() methods)
✅ TypeScript syntax corrections (database mock handling)
✅ TanStack Query configuration (missing queryFn)
