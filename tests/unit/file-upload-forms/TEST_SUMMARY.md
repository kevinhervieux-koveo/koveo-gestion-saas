# File Upload Forms Test Suite Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive test coverage for all submission forms supporting file uploads and image attachments in the Koveo Gestion application.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Unit Tests (`file-upload-forms.test.tsx`)
- **Bug Report Form**: File attachment validation, multiple files, size limits
- **Feature Request Form**: Design mockups, documentation attachments
- **Document Upload Forms**: Metadata handling, file type validation
- **Bill Form**: Receipt attachments, format validation
- **General Validation**: Network errors, empty files, file count limits
- **Progress & Feedback**: Upload progress indicators, user feedback

### 2. API Integration Tests (`file-upload-api.test.ts`)
- **Multipart Form Processing**: Server-side handling of file uploads
- **Database Integration**: File storage and record creation
- **File Validation**: Size limits, type restrictions, corruption detection
- **Error Handling**: Upload failures, temporary file cleanup
- **Concurrent Uploads**: Multiple simultaneous file operations
- **Security**: File type validation, malicious file detection

### 3. End-to-End Tests (`file-upload-e2e.test.tsx`)
- **Complete Workflows**: Full user interactions with file uploads
- **UI Feedback**: Progress indicators, status messages, notifications
- **Cross-Platform**: Mobile compatibility, drag-and-drop support
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation
- **Error Recovery**: Network failures, corruption handling
- **File Management**: Viewing, downloading uploaded files

## Test Execution
```bash
# Run all file upload tests
npm test file-upload

# Run specific test suites
npm test file-upload-forms.test.tsx
npm test file-upload-api.test.ts
npm test file-upload-e2e.test.tsx

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage file-upload
```

## Expected Results
- **Unit Tests**: 25+ test cases covering form interactions
- **API Tests**: 20+ test cases covering server-side processing
- **E2E Tests**: 15+ test cases covering complete workflows
- **Total Coverage**: 95%+ line coverage for file upload functionality

## Integration Points
- ✅ Authentication system (RBAC-based access)
- ✅ Database storage (document records)
- ✅ File system (local upload directory)
- ✅ Toast notifications (user feedback)
- ✅ Form validation (Zod schemas)
- ✅ Query invalidation (cache management)

## Recent Updates
- ✅ Environment field removed from bug reports (as requested)
- ✅ Dropdown menu pattern implemented (matching idea-box)
- ✅ File upload system fully functional
- ✅ Delete functionality fixed
- ✅ RBAC permissions enforced properly

## Maintenance Notes
- Tests use mock files to avoid filesystem dependencies
- API tests include proper cleanup of temporary files
- E2E tests simulate real user interactions with file uploads
- All tests are isolated and can run independently
- Mock authentication provides consistent test user context
